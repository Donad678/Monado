- Fix: Removes unneeded warning in swapchain creation about requested sizes being larger than sizes reported by vkGetImageMemoryRequirements for imported images.
- Fix: Adds new image memory size parameter to D3D12 texture import functions to fix zero size error messages and D3D12 swapchain creation to fail.
