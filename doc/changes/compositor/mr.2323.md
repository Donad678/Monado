- Add: Expose a `comp_render_gfx_layers` (formerly called `do_layers`) to match the `comp_render_cs_layers` function, which squashes layers.
- Improvement: Code and comment cleanup of compositor utilities and modules related to layer squashing and distortion, including renames in in `comp/render/*` and `comp/util/comp_render_*` for consistency.
